############# Building and Installing ###########################

As of 2014.10.30 CMST has had the ability to create and edit config
(provisioning) files. These files are located in /var/lib/connman
which is owned by root:root.  To enable reading and writing in this
directory we have had to add a roothelper program.  This roothelper
is activated automatically by DBus, however it has necessitated a change
in how you build and install.  

In the examples below we use the command "qmake", but if you have
multiple versions of QT installed on your system "qmake" should be 
replaced with "qmake-qt5"

DISTRO= command line option:
In order to use the provisioning editor you must be a member of a group
granted access to network services.  In Arch Linux this is the "network"
group, in Slackware it is the "netdev" group. The DISTRO= command line
option is provided to make sure the conf file in /etc/dbus-1/system.d
contains the proper group name.  Usage Examples:
      qmake DISTRO=arch       // to install on an Arch Linux system
      qmake DISTRO=slackware  // to install on Slackware

If the DISTRO= option is omitted then qmake will default to the Arch
Linux options (network group is "network").

There is no error checking in the .pro files so it is important to make
sure that the options are spelled correctly and in the proper case.

Currently we only have information on Arch Linux and Slackware.  If your
distro uses something different please open up an issue on GitHub, let
us know what your network group is called and we'll add it in.

Roothelper install file location:
By default the roothelper (called cmstroothelper) will be installed in
/usr/lib/cmst.  In Slackware /usr/lib is apparently not used for every
architecture so if you specify and export a variable called USE_LIBPATH
pointing to your install location that location will be used as the
install target instead.
